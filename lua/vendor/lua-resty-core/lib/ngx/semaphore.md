Synopsis
========

Synchronizing threads in the same context
-----------------------------------------

```nginx
location = /t {
    content_by_lua_block {
        local semaphore = require "ngx.semaphore"
        local sema = semaphore.new()

        local function handler()
            ngx.say("sub thread: waiting on sema...")

            local ok, err = sema:wait(1)  -- wait for a second at most
            if not ok then
                ngx.say("sub thread: failed to wait on sema: ", err)
            else
                ngx.say("sub thread: waited successfully.")
            end
        end

        local co = ngx.thread.spawn(handler)

        ngx.say("main thread: sleeping for a little while...")

        ngx.sleep(0.1)  -- wait a bit

        ngx.say("main thread: posting to sema...")

        sema:post(1)

        ngx.say("main thread: end.")
    }
}
```

The example location above produces a response output like this:

```
sub thread: waiting on sema...
main thread: sleeping for a little while...
main thread: posting to sema...
main thread: end.
sub thread: waited successfully.
```

Synchronizing threads in different contexts
-------------------------------------------

```nginx
location = /t {
    content_by_lua_block {
        local semaphore = require "ngx.semaphore"
        local sema = semaphore.new()

        local outputs = {}
        local i = 1

        local function out(s)
            outputs[i] = s
            i = i + 1
        end

        local function handler()
            out("timer thread: sleeping for a little while...")

            ngx.sleep(0.1)  -- wait a bit

            out("timer thread: posting on sema...")

            sema:post(1)
        end

        assert(ngx.timer.at(0, handler))

        out("main thread: waiting on sema...")

        local ok, err = sema:wait(1)  -- wait for a second at most
        if not ok then
            out("main thread: failed to wait on sema: ", err)
        else
            out("main thread: waited successfully.")
        end

        out("main thread: end.")

        ngx.say(table.concat(outputs, "\n"))
    }
}
```

The example location above produces a response body like this

```
main thread: waiting on sema...
timer thread: sleeping for a little while...
timer thread: posting on sema...
main thread: waited successfully.
main thread: end.
```

The same applies to different request contexts as long as these requests are served
by the same nginx worker process.

Description
===========

This module provides an efficient semaphore API for the OpenResty/ngx_lua module. With
semaphores, "light threads" (created by [ngx.thread.spawn](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxthreadspawn),
[ngx.timer.at](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerat), and etc.) can
synchronize among each other very efficiently without constant polling and sleeping.

"Light threads" in different contexts (like in different requests) can share the same
semaphore instance as long as these "light threads" reside in the same NGINX worker
process and the [lua_code_cache](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_code_cache)
directive is turned on (which is the default). For inter-process "light thread" synchronization,
it is recommended to use the [lua-resty-lock](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-lock) library instead
(which is a bit less efficient than this semaphore API though).

This semaphore API has a pure userland implementation which does not involve any system calls nor
block any operating system threads. It works closely with the event model of NGINX without
introducing any extra delay.

Like other APIs provided by this `lua-resty-core` library, the LuaJIT FFI feature is required.

Methods
=======

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

new
---
**syntax:** *sema, err = semaphore_module.new(n?)*

**context:** *init_by_lua&#42;, init_worker_by_lua&#42;, set_by_lua&#42;, rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;, header_filter_by_lua&#42;, body_filter_by_lua&#42;, log_by_lua&#42;, ngx.timer.&#42;*

Creates and returns a new semaphore instance that has `n` (default to `0`) resources.

For example,

```lua
 local semaphore = require "ngx.semaphore"
 local sema, err = semaphore.new()
 if not sema then
     ngx.say("create semaphore failed: ", err)
 end
```

Often the semaphore object created is shared on the NGINX worker process by mounting in a custom Lua module, as
documented below:

https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#data-sharing-within-an-nginx-worker

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

post
--------
**syntax:** *sema:post(n?)*

**context:** *init_by_lua&#42;, init_worker_by_lua&#42;, set_by_lua&#42;, rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;, header_filter_by_lua&#42;, body_filter_by_lua&#42;, log_by_lua&#42;, ngx.timer.&#42;*

Releases `n` (default to `1`) "resources" to the semaphore instance.

This will not yield the current running "light thread".

At most `n` "light threads" will be waken up when the current running "light thread" later yields (or terminates).

```lua
-- typically, we get the semaphore instance from upvalue or globally shared data
-- See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#data-sharing-within-an-nginx-worker

local semaphore = require "ngx.semaphore"
local sema = semaphore.new()

sema:post(2)  -- releases 2 resources
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

wait
----
**syntax:** *ok, err = sema:wait(timeout)*

**context:** *rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;, content_by_lua&#42;, ngx.timer.&#42;*

Requests a resource from the semaphore instance.

Returns `true` immediately when there is resources available for the current running "light thread".
Otherwise the current "light thread" will enter the waiting queue and yield execution.
The current "light thread" will be automatically waken up and the `wait` function call
will return `true` when there is resources available for it, or return `nil` and a string describing
the error in case of failure (like `"timeout"`).

The `timeout` argument specifies the maximum time this function call should wait for (in seconds).

When the `timeout` argument is 0, it means "no wait", that is, when there is no readily available
"resources" for the current running "light thread", this `wait` function call returns immediately
`nil` and the error string `"timeout"`.

You can specify millisecond precision in the timeout value by using floating point numbers like 0.001 (which means 1ms).

"Light threads" created by different contexts (like request handlers) can wait on the
same semaphore instance without problem.

See [Synopsis](#synopsis) for code examples.

count
--------
**syntax:** *count = sema:count()*

**context:** *init_by_lua&#42;, init_worker_by_lua&#42;, set_by_lua&#42;, rewrite_by_lua&#42;, access_by_lua&#42;,
content_by_lua&#42;, header_filter_by_lua&#42;, body_filter_by_lua&#42;, log_by_lua&#42;, ngx.timer.&#42;*

Returns the number of resources readily available in the `sema` semaphore instance (if any).

When the returned number is negative, it means the number of "light threads" waiting on
this semaphore.

Consider the following example,

```lua
local semaphore = require "ngx.semaphore"
local sema = semaphore.new(0)

ngx.say("count: ", sema:count())  -- count: 0

local function handler(id)
    local ok, err = sema:wait(1)
    if not ok then
        ngx.say("err: ", err)
    else
        ngx.say("wait success")
    end
end

local co1 = ngx.thread.spawn(handler)
local co2 = ngx.thread.spawn(handler)

ngx.say("count: ", sema:count())  -- count: -2

sema:post(1)

ngx.say("count: ", sema:count())  -- count: -1

sema:post(2)

ngx.say("count: ", sema:count())  -- count: 1
```
